Title: Guest Management and Loyalty Program





Description:
This code represents a guest management system with a loyalty program. It allows you to input information about guests, such as their names, ranks, and ages. The system provides various functionalities to retrieve guest information, track loyalty points, and calculate average guest age.

Let's understand how the code works:

1. Creating Guest Objects:
The code starts by creating guest objects. Each guest has a last name, first name, rank, and age. The rank and age are converted to integer values for calculations.

2. Guest Information:
The `guest_info(all_guests)` method displays information about all the guests. It takes a list of all guests as input and loops through each guest, printing their first name, last name, and age. This provides an overview of all the guests.

3. Loyalty Points:
The `loyalty_points(all_guests)` method identifies the guests who qualify as gold members based on their ranks. It loops through all guests and checks if their rank is greater than or equal to 10. If so, it prints their last name, indicating that they are gold members.

4. Average Guest Age:
The `guest_age(all_guests)` method calculates the average age of all the guests. It loops through each guest, adds up their ages, and divides the total by the number of guests. The result represents the average age of the customers, which is then printed.

Outside your class, you can interact with the system by entering the number of guests you want to manage. For each guest, you enter their name, last name, rank, and age. The system creates guest objects and stores them in a list. Afterward, it displays the loyalty points for gold members and calculates the average age of all guests.

This code helps manage guest information, track loyalty points for gold members, and calculate the average age of guests. It provides insights into guest details and aids in understanding the customer base for a business or establishment.
