Try to recreate the Class we saw during the introduction of this new topic!

Some key things to remember
    1. Class App
    2. init has 3 properties.  users,storage, username
    3. There are 2 additional methods. (login and increase_capacity)
    4. login method -> Checks if the username is "owner" and users is not empty
        -if true, It will welcome the user and print their storage number
    5. increase_capacity method -> This accepts a number and add this to the current storage value
        -Then printing out the updated amount
    6. Create two objects.  Each object calls both methods.  Be creative

    BONUS:

    Create a bonus method:

    1. Checks, if users is greater than storage.  A upgrade amount is asked, this amount it added to the current storage
    2. Otherwise, Print off the remaining storage left
