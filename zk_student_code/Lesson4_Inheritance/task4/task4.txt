Title: Country Information System


country = {}

country[key] = value

dictionary -> key -> unlocks a value



Description:
The provided code represents a country information system that allows users to retrieve information about different countries. The system is built using class inheritance to categorize countries into two types: developed and developing.

#####

Country Class:
The base class `Country` represents a generic country and stores its name, capital, and population. 

-It provides a method `get_info()` that returns a dictionary containing the country's name, capital, and population.

###

DevelopedCountry Class:
The `DevelopedCountry` class inherits from the `Country` class and adds an additional attribute `gdp` (Gross Domestic Product). 

-It overrides the `get_info()` method to include the GDP in the returned dictionary.

###

DevelopingCountry Class:
The `DevelopingCountry` class also inherits from the `Country` class and introduces the attribute `hdi` (Human Development Index). 

-It overrides the `get_info()` method to include the HDI in the returned dictionary.

###

World Class:
The `World` class serves as a container for multiple countries. 

-It allows the addition of countries with add_country(country) and provides a method `get_country_info()` to retrieve the information for a specific country by its name.


#####

Outside your classes, an instance of the `World` class named `world` is created. Three countries, namely the United States, India, and China, are instantiated as objects of their respective classes and added to the `world` instance.

To retrieve information about a specific country, the `get_country_info()` method is used with the country name as an argument. If the country is found in the `world` instance, its information is displayed. Otherwise, a message indicating that the country was not found is printed.

This code allows users to organize and access information about countries based on their development status. It facilitates the retrieval of data such as the country's name, capital, population, and additional attributes specific to developed or developing countries.
