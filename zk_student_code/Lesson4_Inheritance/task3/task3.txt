#####

Outside your classes, a Library object is created. Four books, including both fiction and non-fiction, are instantiated and added to the library. The display_all_books method is called to print the information of all the books in the library. The search_by_author method is then used to find and display books written by a specific author. Finally, the search_by_year_range method is used to find and display books published within a given year range.

This code provides a basic library management system where you can add books, view all books, search for books by author, and search for books published within a specific time period. It allows for efficient organization and retrieval of book information in a library setting.
